#### Introduction
A simplified Unix-like operating system kernel based on the x86 platform.
This operating system was my undergraduate graduation project, completed by me and my partner as two separate sub-projects. I was responsible for the hardware drivers, memory management, and file system within the kernel.
The `master` branch contains the code I was responsible for, while the `main` branch contains the assembled code. Both branches are runnable, but only the `main` branch contains the complete operating system.
